This code attempts to replicate Angrist-Evans's paper  "Children and Their Parents'Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous
Variation in Family Size" on exploring investigates the impact of additional children on women's labor market outcomes, including participation and income.
The analysis utilizes the detailed microdata from the U.S. Census, provided by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). 
The research strategy used in Angrist-Evan's paper is the construction of an instrumental variable, specifically, the gender composition of a family's first two children. 
The underlying hypothetis is: If parents prefer to have children with mixed gender, having two boys or two girls might inclease their possibility to have third children.
